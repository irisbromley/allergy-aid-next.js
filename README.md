## Allergy Aid

Allergy Aid is an allergy symptom tracker that allows users to log their daily symptoms in their nose, eyes, mouth, throat, and skin, as well as track their location at that moment. The application includes a login and registration system with session token creation, and supports full CRUD functionality. Allergy Aid was designed with a mobile-first approach, but is also responsive to different screen sizes.

### Planning Tools

To plan the project, I utilized DrawSQL and Figma. DrawSQL was used to create a database schema that was easy to understand and modify. You can view the schema I created by following this link: LINK Allergy Aid DrawSQL Schema. Figma was used to create a user interface design that was simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate.

### Technologies Used

Allergy Aid was built using the following technologies:

- Mobile-first design with responsive web design
- Login and registration system with session token creation
- Full CRUD functionality
- DrawSQL and Figma for planning and design
- HTML, Tailwind, TypeScript for the frontend
- Node.js and PostgreSQL for the backend

### Multiple User Support

In addition, Allergy Aid also supports the ability for one user to log symptoms for multiple individuals. This feature allows for more comprehensive tracking of allergies and can provide important information for medical professionals. For example, a parent can log symptoms for their children or a caretaker can log symptoms for their clients.

## Conclusion

Allergy Aid is a powerful and flexible allergy symptom tracker that can be used by individuals, parents, caretakers, and medical professionals. With its comprehensive tracking of symptoms and support for multiple users, it is an essential tool for anyone dealing with allergies.
